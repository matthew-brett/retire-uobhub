    <h1>oubhub.org retired</h1>

    <p> We have retired the uobhub.org JupyterHub server.  If you are looking
    for your notebooks or R scripts from that system, we may still have them.
    Contact <a href="mailto:matthew.brett@gmail.com">Matthew Brett</a> and ask
    him.</p>

    <p>
    Perhaps you were looking for the data science textbook?  If you are
    reading this before June 2024, that should still up at its
    <a href="https://matthew-brett.github.io/cfd2020">usual site</a>.
    If it isn't up, please let Matthew know at the address above.
